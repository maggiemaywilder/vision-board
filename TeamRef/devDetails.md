# User Story

AS AN AUTHORIZED USER
I can create a vision board for the skill I want to learn or improve
I can then select any number of related tags

When I have a vision board
I can create cards related to my learning process 
Including *links* to:
    online classes and videos
    blogs and articles
    archive.org documents
    sources for tools & materials needed
    local in person classes, clubs, events
    links to my personal social media posts related to the process
        (links have to be entered by user)

When the primary tag has been established for my board
I can then choose to search for the links saved by other users to their boards with the same tag

## Additional layers/ future development

    - view anonymous reviews on links 
    - create cards without a link for local events, see those card details in search results
    - specific process for reporting, removing urls or comments for review
    - process for tracking and removing a user based on pattern of inappropriate comments
    - Archive and hybernate

## Other things

I'd like to try to keep up on the kanban and projects
I'd also like to try to do like a virtual version of a daily scrum, since I'm sure everyone will have a different schedule
    Something like posting into the slack at the end of each day what you might say at a daily scrum
        -What you worked on
        -If there's anything you're hung up on with it, etc
